# Disease Prediction Project

This project uses Machine Learning to predict diseases based on user input symptoms. It is implemented in Python using libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The goal of this project is to predict the most probable disease based on symptoms entered by the user. A classification algorithm is trained on a symptoms-to-disease dataset and makes predictions based on input features.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to train and test the model.
